       "'From ushering in an era of decreased car ownership, to narrowing streets and eliminating parking lots, autonomous vehicles promise to dramatically reshape our cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after an Uber-operated self-driving vehicle struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street with her bike in Tempe, Arizona on March 18, 2018, there are more questions than ever about the safety of this technology, especially as these vehicles are being tested more frequently on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome argue the safety record for self-driving cars isnâ€™t proven, and that itâ€™s unclear whether or not enough testing miles have been driven in real-life conditions. Other safety advocates go further, and say that driverless cars are introducing a new problem to cities, when cities should instead be focusing on improving transit and encouraging walking and biking instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nContentions aside, the autonomous revolution is already here, although some cities will see its impacts sooner than others. From Las Vegas, where a Navya self-driving minibus scoots slowly along a downtown street, to General Motorsâ€™ Cruise ride-hailing service in San Francisco with backup humans in the driverâ€™s seat, to Waymoâ€™s family-focused Chandler, Arizonaâ€“based pilot program that uses no human operators in its Chrysler Pacifica minivans at all, the country is accelerating towards a driverless future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the U.S. government has historically been confident in autonomous vehiclesâ€™ ability to end the epidemic of traffic deaths on our streets, there are plenty of concerns from opponents of self-driving cars that are making cities think twice before welcoming them to their streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving vehicles may be poised to deliver a future of safer, greener streets for all, but testing the vehicles on todayâ€™s streets is a concern. Farrells and WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff\\r\\nAre autonomous vehicles safe?\\r\\nIn 2009, Google launched its self-driving project focusing on saving lives and serving people with disabilities. In a 2014 video, Google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles, part of the companyâ€™s plan to â€œimprove road safety and help lots of people who canâ€™t drive.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there were several self-driving projects in the country at the time, many being developed by government agencies or university labs, Googleâ€™s project differentiated itself by being public-facing. The goal was not to build carsâ€”although Google did build its own testing prototypesâ€”but to create a self-driving service that would help regular people get around.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle began testing its vehicles on public streets the very same year the project launched. With the reorganization of Google into its new parent company Alphabet, the self-driving program became its own entity, Waymo. Almost a decade later, Waymo remains the clear leader for safe self-driving miles on U.S. streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 2019, Waymo had logged 10 million self-driven miles, making it the leader for self-driven miles on U.S. streets. Thatâ€™s double the amount of miles Waymo had driven in February 2018. In July 2018, Waymoâ€™s new electric Jaguar I-Paces vehicle hit the streets, in addition to its Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Waymoâ€™s monthly reports, its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes, but caused no serious injuries. In 2016, a Waymo vehicle bumped a bus while going 2 miles per hour. On May 4, 2018, one of Waymoâ€™s minivans was involved in a crash with minor injuries in Chandler, Arizona while in autonomous mode, but police said Waymoâ€™s van was not the â€œviolator vehicle.â€\\x9d In October 2018 a Waymo vehicle was involved in a crash that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with minor injuries, but the human driver was at fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing on U.S. streets, but next most experienced companies, Uber and GM Cruise, are still several million miles behind Waymo. That doesnâ€™t include miles driven in the semi-autonomous modes that many cars now offer, like Teslaâ€™s Autopilot, which are more driver-assistance systems than true self-driving vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last few years, the greatest strides taken in the self-driving industry have been by ride-hailing companies, who are devoting an exceptional amount of time and money to develop their own proprietary technologies and, in many cases, giving members of the public rides in their vehicles. In 2017, Lyftâ€™s CEO predicted that within five years, all their vehicles will be autonomous. At a press conference in March 2018, where Waymoâ€™s CEO John Krafcik announced its ride-hailing program, Krafcik claimed that the company will be making at least one million trips per day by 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCan autonomous cars drive better than humans?\\r\\nThe biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a humanâ€”it is programmed to obey all the rules of the road, wonâ€™t speed, and canâ€™t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone. And, hypothetically at least, AVs can also detect what humans canâ€™tâ€”especially at night or in low-light conditionsâ€”and react more quickly to avoid a collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAVs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road. One key technology for AVs is LIDAR, or a â€œlight-detecting and rangingâ€\\x9d sensor. Using millions of lasers, LIDAR draws a real-time, 3D image of the environment around the vehicle. In addition to LIDAR, radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects. And high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals. As the car is traveling, it cross-references all this data with GPS technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the sensors and maps, AVs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles, humans, or objects in the road. Engineers can run the cars through simulations, but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations. This is why real-world testing on public roads is so important.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how AV companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users, like cyclists, and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets, like seniors and children. Waymo, for example, claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists. A video that Waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of Google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a May 2018 report from The Information, Uberâ€™s vehicle did detect Herzberg before its fatal Tempe crash, but the system made a decision not to swerve. â€œThe carâ€™s sensors detected the pedestrian, who was crossing the street with a bicycle, but Uberâ€™s software decided it didnâ€™t need to react right away.â€\\x9d A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed that not only had Uber disabled the Volvo SUVâ€™s collision-avoidance feature, Uberâ€™s own system detected Herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 1.3 seconds before impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Arizona prosecutors did not charge Uber, writing in a letter that â€œthere is no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUberâ€™s self-driving unit Arizona announced it was closing down on May 23, 2018. In July, Uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uberâ€™s self-driving program has since returned to Pittsburgh, where it is limiting testing to daylight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of human â€œbackup driversâ€\\x9d as part of AV testing has also come into question after Tempe police documents obtained by Gizmodo showed that driver Rafaela Vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of Uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œThe driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,â€\\x9d reads the report, which calls the crash â€œentirely avoidable.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2019, the final NTSB report attributed the crash to human error, but placed much of the blame on Vasquez. At the NTSB hearing, board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets. Many traditional automakers use a facility named M City in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles. Waymoâ€™s fake city, named Castle, even has a shed full of propsâ€”like tricyclesâ€”that might be used by people on streets so that Waymoâ€™s engineers can learn how to identify them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Uberâ€™s fatal crash, Toyota built a new facility to test its vehiclesâ€™ responses to â€œedge casesâ€\\x9dâ€”extreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOT has been testing autonomous technology at the M City facility for many years. M City\\r\\nWill eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths?\\r\\n50 years ago, the U.S.â€™s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are nowâ€”in 1980, generally considered to be the deadliest year on U.S. streets, over 50,000 people were killed. With safety features like airbags added to vehicles, stricter seat belt laws, and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving, the rate of deaths went down significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut over the last few years, the U.S. has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again. Additionally, pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade, while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent. There isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths are increasing, but some experts believe that this is because Americans are driving moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) reached an all-time high in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing USDOTâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel. But itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced, the U.S. could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand, routed more efficiently, and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline, but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced, meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects, like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet. If cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation, that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit. According to a 2016 American Public Transportation Association study, traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout having to make room for so many cars, city streets can be narrowed, making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities. In this way, autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a Vision Zero strategy, which most major U.S. cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical U.S. roadway remade as a safe, accessible street filled with autonomous technology, from shared taxibots to self-driving buses, from NACTOâ€™s Blueprint for Autonomous Urbanism. NACTO\\r\\nBut arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now, too?\\r\\nWhile residents of only a few cities can summon an AV on-demand right now, the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into todayâ€™s cars. Sophisticated collision-avoidance systems, for example, which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path, are already being incorporated into new cars and buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why the way the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing. Until recently, all safety standards were based on historical crash data, meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and, in many cases, deaths) before making an official recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, technology is advancing so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade. The government knows it needs to be more nimble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, thatâ€™s what happened for a recent USDOT recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), a tool which allows cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other. This recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by U.S. transportation secretary Anthony Foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obviousâ€”there was no need to spend years collecting historical data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech. Once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry, a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 8-person autonomous shuttle by Navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in Downtown Las Vegas. Keolis\\r\\nWhere are self-driving cars being tested?\\r\\nAbout half of U.S. states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, but regulations for each state vary widely. The majority of testing is focused in a handful of states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia remains the busiest hub for the AV industry: There are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the stateâ€™s streets. Itâ€™s also one of the most heavily regulated markets: Californiaâ€™s Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile itâ€™s not necessarily used as a safety metric, one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over, which is called a â€œdisengagement.â€\\x9d California DMV records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience, they see fewer and fewer disengagements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther states donâ€™t require as much documentation as Californiaâ€”and theyâ€™re not necessarily required to make any information public. Arizona, for example, approved AV testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents, and didnâ€™t require any reports from companies, although after Uberâ€™s fatal crash, that has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nUber Self-Driving Car\\r\\nHills, snow, quirky local driving customs, and loose state regulations are some of the reasons Uber started testing its self-driving program in Pittsburgh. AP Photo/Jared Wickerham\\r\\nDoes the federal government regulate autonomous vehicles?\\r\\nIn 2016, the U.S. government released its long-awaited rules on self-driving vehicles. The Department of Transportationâ€™s 116-page document lists many benefits for bringing technology to market, among them improved sustainability, productivity, and accessibility. But the USDOT reportâ€™s central promise is that autonomy will pave the way for policies that dramatically improve road safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven President Obama made the case for safety in an op-ed that heralded the dawn of the new driverless age:\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, too many people die on our roadsâ€”35,200 last year aloneâ€”with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice. Automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. And right now, for too many senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, driving isnâ€™t an option. Automated vehicles could change their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to get cities across the country to start thinking about using autonomy to solve transportation problems, USDOT hosted the Smart City Challenge in 2016, which awarded $40 million to Columbus, Ohio, to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles. As a result of the challenge, the 70 cities that competed now have blueprints for how to introduce AV tech to their transportation planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Trump administration, much of the legislation proposed has been centered around exemptions for automakers and increasing the number of AVs allowed to operate on U.S. streets. In fact, in September 2017, USDOT and NHTSA issued updated AV guidelines, which carried an even lighter regulatory touch, after industry leaders expressed concerns about regulation at the federal level stifling innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the 2017 policy statement, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao held preliminary hearings about autonomous vehicles where she affirmed the government would not play a heavy-handed role. â€œThe market will decide what is the most effective solution,â€\\x9d she said. However, the aggressive development of V2Vâ€”which experts agree can work to make human-driven cars much safer as autonomous technology comes to marketâ€”has not been made a priority during her leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 4, 2018, USDOT announced new guidelines to guide development and deployment of AVs, including the possibility that the department would change its safety standard rules to allow new types of autonomous vehicles to operate on U.S. roads. This would mean potentially making exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operating features like steering wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nChao also addressed the fact that public acceptance was a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption. â€œCompanies need to step up and address the publicâ€™s concerns about safety,â€\\x9d she said. â€œBecause without public acceptance, the full potential of these technologies may never be realized.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOTâ€™s lack of regulation was called out as â€œlaughableâ€\\x9d by NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy during the November 2019 hearings about Uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œI actually think that there is a major failing on the federal governmentâ€™s part and the state of Arizona, because they also didnâ€™t have any standards in place and still donâ€™t, for failing to regulate these operations,â€\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 8, 2020, Chao announced AV 4.0, a new set of voluntary guidelines which reconfirms the federal governmentâ€™s hands-off approach to AV regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was quickly panned by safety advocates, including Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, who cited Uberâ€™s fatal crash, among others, in a statement denouncing AV 4.0. â€œDespite these disturbing incidents, the agency tasked with ensuring public safety on our roadways has abrogated their responsibility to issue rules requiring minimum performance standards for AVs.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTeslaâ€™s Autopilot feature, one of many driver-assist features which allow control of the vehicle to switch from human to computer, can distract drivers or give them a false sense of security. The Verge\\r\\nWhatâ€™s the difference between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous?\\r\\nThereâ€™s one safety debate that continues to divide the self-driving industry: Some automakers are still pushing for versions of vehicles which allow control to pass from human to computer, offering drivers the ability to toggle between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous modes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo fatal Tesla crashesâ€”one in 2016 and one in 2018â€”that occurred while the drivers were using the vehicleâ€™s Autopilot feature illustrated the dangers of a semi-autonomous mode. As the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) noted in its report of the 2016 crash, semi-autonomous systems give â€œfar more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFully autonomous is the official policy recommendation from the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, a lobbying group that wants cars to eventually phase out steering wheels and let the software take over, 100 percent of the time. This completely eliminates the potential for human error.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Waymo began conducting fully autonomous testing in Arizona without a human safety driver, and in 2019, began transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles. California now allows fully autonomous testing as well, but without passengers for now.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially after the Uber crash, San Francisco bike advocates worry that the tech isnâ€™t powerful enough to see cyclists. The California Bicycle Coalition started a petition to stop fully autonomous vehicles from being tested on California streets.\\r\\n'"

       "'From ushering in an era of decreased car ownership, to narrowing streets and eliminating parking lots, autonomous vehicles promise to dramatically reshape our cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after an Uber-operated self-driving vehicle struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street with her bike in Tempe, Arizona on March 18, 2018, there are more questions than ever about the safety of this technology, especially as these vehicles are being tested more frequently on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome argue the safety record for self-driving cars isnâ€™t proven, and that itâ€™s unclear whether or not enough testing miles have been driven in real-life conditions. Other safety advocates go further, and say that driverless cars are introducing a new problem to cities, when cities should instead be focusing on improving transit and encouraging walking and biking instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nContentions aside, the autonomous revolution is already here, although some cities will see its impacts sooner than others. From Las Vegas, where a Navya self-driving minibus scoots slowly along a downtown street, to General Motorsâ€™ Cruise ride-hailing service in San Francisco with backup humans in the driverâ€™s seat, to Waymoâ€™s family-focused Chandler, Arizonaâ€“based pilot program that uses no human operators in its Chrysler Pacifica minivans at all, the country is accelerating towards a driverless future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the U.S. government has historically been confident in autonomous vehiclesâ€™ ability to end the epidemic of traffic deaths on our streets, there are plenty of concerns from opponents of self-driving cars that are making cities think twice before welcoming them to their streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving vehicles may be poised to deliver a future of safer, greener streets for all, but testing the vehicles on todayâ€™s streets is a concern. Farrells and WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff\\r\\nAre autonomous vehicles safe?\\r\\nIn 2009, Google launched its self-driving project focusing on saving lives and serving people with disabilities. In a 2014 video, Google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles, part of the companyâ€™s plan to â€œimprove road safety and help lots of people who canâ€™t drive.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there were several self-driving projects in the country at the time, many being developed by government agencies or university labs, Googleâ€™s project differentiated itself by being public-facing. The goal was not to build carsâ€”although Google did build its own testing prototypesâ€”but to create a self-driving service that would help regular people get around.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle began testing its vehicles on public streets the very same year the project launched. With the reorganization of Google into its new parent company Alphabet, the self-driving program became its own entity, Waymo. Almost a decade later, Waymo remains the clear leader for safe self-driving miles on U.S. streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 2019, Waymo had logged 10 million self-driven miles, making it the leader for self-driven miles on U.S. streets. Thatâ€™s double the amount of miles Waymo had driven in February 2018. In July 2018, Waymoâ€™s new electric Jaguar I-Paces vehicle hit the streets, in addition to its Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Waymoâ€™s monthly reports, its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes, but caused no serious injuries. In 2016, a Waymo vehicle bumped a bus while going 2 miles per hour. On May 4, 2018, one of Waymoâ€™s minivans was involved in a crash with minor injuries in Chandler, Arizona while in autonomous mode, but police said Waymoâ€™s van was not the â€œviolator vehicle.â€\\x9d In October 2018 a Waymo vehicle was involved in a crash that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with minor injuries, but the human driver was at fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing on U.S. streets, but next most experienced companies, Uber and GM Cruise, are still several million miles behind Waymo. That doesnâ€™t include miles driven in the semi-autonomous modes that many cars now offer, like Teslaâ€™s Autopilot, which are more driver-assistance systems than true self-driving vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last few years, the greatest strides taken in the self-driving industry have been by ride-hailing companies, who are devoting an exceptional amount of time and money to develop their own proprietary technologies and, in many cases, giving members of the public rides in their vehicles. In 2017, Lyftâ€™s CEO predicted that within five years, all their vehicles will be autonomous. At a press conference in March 2018, where Waymoâ€™s CEO John Krafcik announced its ride-hailing program, Krafcik claimed that the company will be making at least one million trips per day by 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCan autonomous cars drive better than humans?\\r\\nThe biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a humanâ€”it is programmed to obey all the rules of the road, wonâ€™t speed, and canâ€™t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone. And, hypothetically at least, AVs can also detect what humans canâ€™tâ€”especially at night or in low-light conditionsâ€”and react more quickly to avoid a collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAVs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road. One key technology for AVs is LIDAR, or a â€œlight-detecting and rangingâ€\\x9d sensor. Using millions of lasers, LIDAR draws a real-time, 3D image of the environment around the vehicle. In addition to LIDAR, radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects. And high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals. As the car is traveling, it cross-references all this data with GPS technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the sensors and maps, AVs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles, humans, or objects in the road. Engineers can run the cars through simulations, but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations. This is why real-world testing on public roads is so important.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how AV companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users, like cyclists, and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets, like seniors and children. Waymo, for example, claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists. A video that Waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of Google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a May 2018 report from The Information, Uberâ€™s vehicle did detect Herzberg before its fatal Tempe crash, but the system made a decision not to swerve. â€œThe carâ€™s sensors detected the pedestrian, who was crossing the street with a bicycle, but Uberâ€™s software decided it didnâ€™t need to react right away.â€\\x9d A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed that not only had Uber disabled the Volvo SUVâ€™s collision-avoidance feature, Uberâ€™s own system detected Herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 1.3 seconds before impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Arizona prosecutors did not charge Uber, writing in a letter that â€œthere is no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUberâ€™s self-driving unit Arizona announced it was closing down on May 23, 2018. In July, Uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uberâ€™s self-driving program has since returned to Pittsburgh, where it is limiting testing to daylight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of human â€œbackup driversâ€\\x9d as part of AV testing has also come into question after Tempe police documents obtained by Gizmodo showed that driver Rafaela Vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of Uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œThe driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,â€\\x9d reads the report, which calls the crash â€œentirely avoidable.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2019, the final NTSB report attributed the crash to human error, but placed much of the blame on Vasquez. At the NTSB hearing, board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets. Many traditional automakers use a facility named M City in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles. Waymoâ€™s fake city, named Castle, even has a shed full of propsâ€”like tricyclesâ€”that might be used by people on streets so that Waymoâ€™s engineers can learn how to identify them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Uberâ€™s fatal crash, Toyota built a new facility to test its vehiclesâ€™ responses to â€œedge casesâ€\\x9dâ€”extreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOT has been testing autonomous technology at the M City facility for many years. M City\\r\\nWill eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths?\\r\\n50 years ago, the U.S.â€™s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are nowâ€”in 1980, generally considered to be the deadliest year on U.S. streets, over 50,000 people were killed. With safety features like airbags added to vehicles, stricter seat belt laws, and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving, the rate of deaths went down significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut over the last few years, the U.S. has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again. Additionally, pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade, while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent. There isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths are increasing, but some experts believe that this is because Americans are driving moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) reached an all-time high in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing USDOTâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel. But itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced, the U.S. could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand, routed more efficiently, and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline, but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced, meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects, like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet. If cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation, that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit. According to a 2016 American Public Transportation Association study, traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout having to make room for so many cars, city streets can be narrowed, making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities. In this way, autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a Vision Zero strategy, which most major U.S. cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical U.S. roadway remade as a safe, accessible street filled with autonomous technology, from shared taxibots to self-driving buses, from NACTOâ€™s Blueprint for Autonomous Urbanism. NACTO\\r\\nBut arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now, too?\\r\\nWhile residents of only a few cities can summon an AV on-demand right now, the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into todayâ€™s cars. Sophisticated collision-avoidance systems, for example, which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path, are already being incorporated into new cars and buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why the way the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing. Until recently, all safety standards were based on historical crash data, meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and, in many cases, deaths) before making an official recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, technology is advancing so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade. The government knows it needs to be more nimble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, thatâ€™s what happened for a recent USDOT recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), a tool which allows cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other. This recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by U.S. transportation secretary Anthony Foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obviousâ€”there was no need to spend years collecting historical data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech. Once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry, a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 8-person autonomous shuttle by Navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in Downtown Las Vegas. Keolis\\r\\nWhere are self-driving cars being tested?\\r\\nAbout half of U.S. states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, but regulations for each state vary widely. The majority of testing is focused in a handful of states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia remains the busiest hub for the AV industry: There are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the stateâ€™s streets. Itâ€™s also one of the most heavily regulated markets: Californiaâ€™s Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile itâ€™s not necessarily used as a safety metric, one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over, which is called a â€œdisengagement.â€\\x9d California DMV records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience, they see fewer and fewer disengagements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther states donâ€™t require as much documentation as Californiaâ€”and theyâ€™re not necessarily required to make any information public. Arizona, for example, approved AV testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents, and didnâ€™t require any reports from companies, although after Uberâ€™s fatal crash, that has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nUber Self-Driving Car\\r\\nHills, snow, quirky local driving customs, and loose state regulations are some of the reasons Uber started testing its self-driving program in Pittsburgh.

Automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. And right now, for too many senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, driving isnâ€™t an option. Automated vehicles could change their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to get cities across the country to start thinking about using autonomy to solve transportation problems, USDOT hosted the Smart City Challenge in 2016, which awarded $40 million to Columbus, Ohio, to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles. As a result of the challenge, the 70 cities that competed now have blueprints for how to introduce AV tech to their transportation planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Trump administration, much of the legislation proposed has been centered around exemptions for automakers and increasing the number of AVs allowed to operate on U.S. streets. In fact, in September 2017, USDOT and NHTSA issued updated AV guidelines, which carried an even lighter regulatory touch, after industry leaders expressed concerns about regulation at the federal level stifling innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the 2017 policy statement, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao held preliminary hearings about autonomous vehicles where she affirmed the government would not play a heavy-handed role. â€œThe market will decide what is the most effective solution,â€\\x9d she said.

This would mean potentially making exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operating features like steering wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nChao also addressed the fact that public acceptance was a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption. â€œCompanies need to step up and address the publicâ€™s concerns about safety,â€\\x9d she said. â€œBecause without public acceptance, the full potential of these technologies may never be realized.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOTâ€™s lack of regulation was called out as â€œlaughableâ€\\x9d by NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy during the November 2019 hearings about Uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œI actually think that there is a major failing on the federal governmentâ€™s part and the state of Arizona, because they also didnâ€™t have any standards in place and still donâ€™t, for failing to regulate these operations,â€\\x9d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 8, 2020, Chao announced AV 4.0, a new set of voluntary guidelines which reconfirms the federal governmentâ€™s hands-off approach to AV regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was quickly panned by safety advocates, including Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, who cited Uberâ€™s fatal crash, among others, in a statement denouncing AV 4.0. â€œDespite these disturbing incidents, the agency tasked with ensuring public safety on our roadways has abrogated their responsibility to issue rules requiring minimum performance standards for AVs.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTeslaâ€™s Autopilot feature, one of many driver-assist features which allow control of the vehicle to switch from human to computer, can distract drivers or give them a false sense of security.

This completely eliminates the potential for human error.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Waymo began conducting fully autonomous testing in Arizona without a human safety driver, and in 2019, began transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles. California now allows fully autonomous testing as well, but without passengers for now.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially after the Uber crash, San Francisco bike advocates worry that the tech isnâ€™t powerful enough to see cyclists.

       "'From ushering in an era of decreased car ownership, to narrowing streets and eliminating parking lots, autonomous vehicles promise to dramatically reshape our cities. But after an Uber-operated self-driving vehicle struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street with her bike in Tempe, Arizona on March 18, 2018, there are more questions than ever about the safety of this technology, especially as these vehicles are being tested more frequently on public streets. Some argue the safety record for self-driving cars isnâ€™t proven, and that itâ€™s unclear whether or not enough testing miles have been driven in real-life conditions. Other safety advocates go further, and say that driverless cars are introducing a new problem to cities, when cities should instead be focusing on improving transit and encouraging walking and biking instead. Contentions aside, the autonomous revolution is already here, although some cities will see its impacts sooner than others. From Las Vegas, where a Navya self-driving minibus scoots slowly along a downtown street, to General Motorsâ€™ Cruise ride-hailing service in San Francisco with backup humans in the driverâ€™s seat, to Waymoâ€™s family-focused Chandler, Arizonaâ€“based pilot program that uses no human operators in its Chrysler Pacifica minivans at all, the country is accelerating towards a driverless future. While the U.S. government has historically been confident in autonomous vehiclesâ€™ ability to end the epidemic of traffic deaths on our streets, there are plenty of concerns from opponents of self-driving cars that are making cities think twice before welcoming them to their streets.   Self-driving vehicles may be poised to deliver a future of safer, greener streets for all, but testing the vehicles on todayâ€™s streets is a concern. Farrells and WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff  Are autonomous vehicles safe?  In 2009, Google launched its self-driving project focusing on saving lives and serving people with disabilities. In a 2014 video, Google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles, part of the companyâ€™s plan to â€œimprove road safety and help lots of people who canâ€™t drive.â€\\x9d Although there were several self-driving projects in the country at the time, many being developed by government agencies or university labs, Googleâ€™s project differentiated itself by being public-facing. The goal was not to build carsâ€”although Google did build its own testing prototypesâ€”but to create a self-driving service that would help regular people get around. Google began testing its vehicles on public streets the very same year the project launched. With the reorganization of Google into its new parent company Alphabet, the self-driving program became its own entity, Waymo. Almost a decade later, Waymo remains the clear leader for safe self-driving miles on U.S. streets. As of November 2019, Waymo had logged 10 million self-driven miles, making it the leader for self-driven miles on U.S. streets. Thatâ€™s double the amount of miles Waymo had driven in February 2018. In July 2018, Waymoâ€™s new electric Jaguar I-Paces vehicle hit the streets, in addition to its Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. According to Waymoâ€™s monthly reports, its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes, but caused no serious injuries. In 2016, a Waymo vehicle bumped a bus while going 2 miles per hour. On May 4, 2018, one of Waymoâ€™s minivans was involved in a crash with minor injuries in Chandler, Arizona while in autonomous mode, but police said Waymoâ€™s van was not the â€œviolator vehicle.â€\\x9d In October 2018 a Waymo vehicle was involved in a crash that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with minor injuries, but the human driver was at fault. Now there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing on U.S. streets, but next most experienced companies, Uber and GM Cruise, are still several million miles behind Waymo. That doesnâ€™t include miles driven in the semi-autonomous modes that many cars now offer, like Teslaâ€™s Autopilot, which are more driver-assistance systems than true self-driving vehicles. In the last few years, the greatest strides taken in the self-driving industry have been by ride-hailing companies, who are devoting an exceptional amount of time and money to develop their own proprietary technologies and, in many cases, giving members of the public rides in their vehicles. In 2017, Lyftâ€™s CEO predicted that within five years, all their vehicles will be autonomous. At a press conference in March 2018, where Waymoâ€™s CEO John Krafcik announced its ride-hailing program, Krafcik claimed that the company will be making at least one million trips per day by 2020.  Can autonomous cars drive better than humans?  The biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a humanâ€”it is programmed to obey all the rules of the road, wonâ€™t speed, and canâ€™t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone. And, hypothetically at least, AVs can also detect what humans canâ€™tâ€”especially at night or in low-light conditionsâ€”and react more quickly to avoid a collision. AVs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road. One key technology for AVs is LIDAR, or a â€œlight-detecting and rangingâ€\\x9d sensor. Using millions of lasers, LIDAR draws a real-time, 3D image of the environment around the vehicle. In addition to LIDAR, radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects. And high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals. As the car is traveling, it cross-references all this data with GPS technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route. In addition to the sensors and maps, AVs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles, humans, or objects in the road. Engineers can run the cars through simulations, but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations. This is why real-world testing on public roads is so important. But how AV companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users, like cyclists, and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets, like seniors and children. Waymo, for example, claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists. A video that Waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of Google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night. According to a May 2018 report from The Information, Uberâ€™s vehicle did detect Herzberg before its fatal Tempe crash, but the system made a decision not to swerve. â€œThe carâ€™s sensors detected the pedestrian, who was crossing the street with a bicycle, but Uberâ€™s software decided it didnâ€™t need to react right away.â€\\x9d A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed that not only had Uber disabled the Volvo SUVâ€™s collision-avoidance feature, Uberâ€™s own system detected Herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 1.3 seconds before impact. However, Arizona prosecutors did not charge Uber, writing in a letter that â€œthere is no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter.â€\\x9d Uberâ€™s self-driving unit Arizona announced it was closing down on May 23, 2018. In July, Uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uberâ€™s self-driving program has since returned to Pittsburgh, where it is limiting testing to daylight hours. The role of human â€œbackup driversâ€\\x9d as part of AV testing has also come into question after Tempe police documents obtained by Gizmodo showed that driver Rafaela Vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of Uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œThe driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,â€\\x9d reads the report, which calls the crash â€œentirely avoidable.â€\\x9d In November 2019, the final NTSB report attributed the crash to human error, but placed much of the blame on Vasquez. At the NTSB hearing, board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax. Self-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets. Many traditional automakers use a facility named M City in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles. Waymoâ€™s fake city, named Castle, even has a shed full of propsâ€”like tricyclesâ€”that might be used by people on streets so that Waymoâ€™s engineers can learn how to identify them. After Uberâ€™s fatal crash, Toyota built a new facility to test its vehiclesâ€™ responses to â€œedge casesâ€\\x9dâ€”extreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets.   USDOT has been testing autonomous technology at the M City facility for many years. M City  Will eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths?  50 years ago, the U.S.â€™s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are nowâ€”in 1980, generally considered to be the deadliest year on U.S. streets, over 50,000 people were killed. With safety features like airbags added to vehicles, stricter seat belt laws, and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving, the rate of deaths went down significantly. But over the last few years, the U.S. has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again. Additionally, pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade, while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent. There isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths are increasing, but some experts believe that this is because Americans are driving moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) reached an all-time high in 2017. Using USDOTâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel. But itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced, the U.S. could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that, too. The real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand, routed more efficiently, and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline, but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced, meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled. In addition, cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects, like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet. If cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation, that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit. According to a 2016 American Public Transportation Association study, traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car. Without having to make room for so many cars, city streets can be narrowed, making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities. In this way, autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a Vision Zero strategy, which most major U.S. cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths.   A typical U.S. roadway remade as a safe, accessible street filled with autonomous technology, from shared taxibots to self-driving buses, from NACTOâ€™s Blueprint for Autonomous Urbanism. NACTO  But arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now, too?  While residents of only a few cities can summon an AV on-demand right now, the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into todayâ€™s cars. Sophisticated collision-avoidance systems, for example, which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path, are already being incorporated into new cars and buses. This is why the way the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing. Until recently, all safety standards were based on historical crash data, meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and, in many cases, deaths) before making an official recommendation. Now, technology is advancing so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade. The government knows it needs to be more nimble. In fact, thatâ€™s what happened for a recent USDOT recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), a tool which allows cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other. This recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by U.S. transportation secretary Anthony Foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obviousâ€”there was no need to spend years collecting historical data. The same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech. Once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry, a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles.   An 8-person autonomous shuttle by Navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in Downtown Las Vegas. Keolis  Where are self-driving cars being tested?  About half of U.S. states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, but regulations for each state vary widely. The majority of testing is focused in a handful of states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington. California remains the busiest hub for the AV industry: There are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the stateâ€™s streets. Itâ€™s also one of the most heavily regulated markets: Californiaâ€™s Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes. While itâ€™s not necessarily used as a safety metric, one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over, which is called a â€œdisengagement.â€\\x9d California DMV records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience, they see fewer and fewer disengagements. Other states donâ€™t require as much documentation as Californiaâ€”and theyâ€™re not necessarily required to make any information public. Arizona, for example, approved AV testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents, and didnâ€™t require any reports from companies, although after Uberâ€™s fatal crash, that has changed. Uber Self-Driving Car  Hills, snow, quirky local driving customs, and loose state regulations are some of the reasons Uber started testing its self-driving program in Pittsburgh.

 the biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a humanâ€”it is programmed to obey all the rules of the road, wonâ€™t speed, and canâ€™t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone. and, hypothetically at least, avs can also detect what humans canâ€™tâ€”especially at night or in low-light conditionsâ€”and react more quickly to avoid a collision. avs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road. one key technology for avs is lidar, or a â€œlight-detecting and rangingâ€\\x9d sensor. using millions of lasers, lidar draws a real-time, 3d image of the environment around the vehicle. in addition to lidar, radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects. and high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals. as the car is traveling, it cross-references all this data with gps technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route. in addition to the sensors and maps, avs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles, humans, or objects in the road. engineers can run the cars through simulations, but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations. this is why real-world testing on public roads is so important. but how av companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users, like cyclists, and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets, like seniors and children. waymo, for example, claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists. a video that waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night. according to a may 2018 report from the information, uberâ€™s vehicle did detect herzberg before its fatal tempe crash, but the system made a decision not to swerve. â€œthe carâ€™s sensors detected the pedestrian, who was crossing the street with a bicycle, but uberâ€™s software decided it didnâ€™t need to react right away.â€\\x9d a preliminary report by the national transportation safety board (ntsb) confirmed that not only had uber disabled the volvo suvâ€™s collision-avoidance feature, uberâ€™s own system detected herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 1.3 seconds before impact. however, arizona prosecutors did not charge uber, writing in a letter that â€œthere is no basis for criminal liability for the uber corporation arising from this matter.â€\\x9d uberâ€™s self-driving unit arizona announced it was closing down on may 23, 2018. in july, uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in pittsburgh and san francisco. uberâ€™s self-driving program has since returned to pittsburgh, where it is limiting testing to daylight hours. the role of human â€œbackup driversâ€\\x9d as part of av testing has also come into question after tempe police documents obtained by gizmodo showed that driver rafaela vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œthe driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,â€\\x9d reads the report, which calls the crash â€œentirely avoidable.â€\\x9d in november 2019, the final ntsb report attributed the crash to human error, but placed much of the blame on vasquez. at the ntsb hearing, board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax. self-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets. many traditional automakers use a facility named m city in ann arbor, michigan, but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles. waymoâ€™s fake city, named castle, even has a shed full of propsâ€”like tricyclesâ€”that might be used by people on streets so that waymoâ€™s engineers can learn how to identify them. after uberâ€™s fatal crash, toyota built a new facility to test its vehiclesâ€™ responses to â€œedge casesâ€\\x9dâ€”extreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets.   usdot has been testing autonomous technology at the m city facility for many years. m city  will eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths?  50 years ago, the u.s.â€™s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are nowâ€”in 1980, generally considered to be the deadliest year on u.s. streets, over 50,000 people were killed. with safety features like airbags added to vehicles, stricter seat belt laws, and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving, the rate of deaths went down significantly. but over the last few years, the u.s. has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again. additionally, pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade, while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent. there isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths are increasing, but some experts believe that this is because americans are driving moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles traveled (vmt) reached an all-time high in 2017. using usdotâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel. but itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced, the u.s. could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that, too. the real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand, routed more efficiently, and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline, but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced, meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled. in addition, cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects, like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet. if cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation, that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit. according to a 2016 american public transportation association study, traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car. without having to make room for so many cars, city streets can be narrowed, making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities. in this way, autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a vision zero strategy, which most major u.s. cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths.   a typical u.s. roadway remade as a safe, accessible street filled with autonomous technology, from shared taxibots to self-driving buses, from nactoâ€™s blueprint for autonomous urbanism. nacto  but arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now, too?  while residents of only a few cities can summon an av on-demand right now, the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into todayâ€™s cars. sophisticated collision-avoidance systems, for example, which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path, are already being incorporated into new cars and buses. this is why the way the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing. until recently, all safety standards were based on historical crash data, meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and, in many cases, deaths) before making an official recommendation. now, technology is advancing so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade. the government knows it needs to be more nimble. in fact, thatâ€™s what happened for a recent usdot recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (v2v), a tool which allows cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other. this recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by u.s. transportation secretary anthony foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obviousâ€”there was no need to spend years collecting historical data. the same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech. once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry, a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles.   an 8-person autonomous shuttle by navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in downtown las vegas. keolis  where are self-driving cars being tested?  about half of u.s. states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, but regulations for each state vary widely. the majority of testing is focused in a handful of states: arizona, california, georgia, michigan, nevada, texas, pennsylvania, and washington. california remains the busiest hub for the av industry: there are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the stateâ€™s streets. itâ€™s also one of the most heavily regulated markets: californiaâ€™s department of motor vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes. while itâ€™s not necessarily used as a safety metric, one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over, which is called a â€œdisengagement.â€\\x9d california dmv records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience, they see fewer and fewer disengagements. other states donâ€™t require as much documentation as californiaâ€”and theyâ€™re not necessarily required to make any information public. arizona, for example, approved av testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents, and didnâ€™t require any reports from companies, although after uberâ€™s fatal crash, that has changed. uber self-driving car  hills, snow, quirky local driving customs, and loose state regulations are some of the reasons uber started testing its self-driving program in pittsburgh. ap photo/jared wickerham  does the federal government regulate autonomous vehicles?  in 2016, the u.s. government released its long-awaited rules on self-driving vehicles. the department of transportationâ€™s 116-page document lists many benefits for bringing technology to market, among them improved sustainability, productivity, and accessibility. but the usdot reportâ€™s central promise is that autonomy will pave the way for policies that dramatically improve road safety. even president obama made the case for safety in an op-ed that heralded the dawn of the new driverless age: right now, too many people die on our roadsâ€”35,200 last year aloneâ€”with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice. automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. and right now, for too many senior citizens and americans with disabilities, driving isnâ€™t an option. automated vehicles could change their lives. in order to get cities across the country to start thinking about using autonomy to solve transportation problems, usdot hosted the smart city challenge in 2016, which awarded $40 million to columbus, ohio, to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles. as a result of the challenge, the 70 cities that competed now have blueprints for how to introduce av tech to their transportation planning. under the trump administration, much of the legislation proposed has been centered around exemptions for automakers and increasing the number of avs allowed to operate on u.s. streets. in fact, in september 2017, usdot and nhtsa issued updated av guidelines, which carried an even lighter regulatory touch, after industry leaders expressed concerns about regulation at the federal level stifling innovation. in addition to the 2017 policy statement, transportation secretary elaine chao held preliminary hearings about autonomous vehicles where she affirmed the government would not play a heavy-handed role. â€œthe market will decide what is the most effective solution,â€\\x9d she said. however, the aggressive development of v2vâ€”which experts agree can work to make human-driven cars much safer as autonomous technology comes to marketâ€”has not been made a priority during her leadership. on october 4, 2018, usdot announced new guidelines to guide development and deployment of avs, including the possibility that the department would change its safety standard rules to allow new types of autonomous vehicles to operate on u.s. roads. this would mean potentially making exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operating features like steering wheels. chao also addressed the fact that public acceptance was a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption. â€œcompanies need to step up and address the publicâ€™s concerns about safety,â€\\x9d she said. â€œbecause without public acceptance, the full potential of these technologies may never be realized.â€\\x9d usdotâ€™s lack of regulation was called out as â€œlaughableâ€\\x9d by ntsb board member jennifer homendy during the november 2019 hearings about uberâ€™s fatal crash. â€œi actually think that there is a major failing on the federal governmentâ€™s part and the state of arizona, because they also didnâ€™t have any standards in place and still donâ€™t, for failing to regulate these operations,â€\\x9d she said. in a speech at the consumer electronics show on january 8, 2020, chao announced av 4.0, a new set of voluntary guidelines which reconfirms the federal governmentâ€™s hands-off approach to av regulation. the plan was quickly panned by safety advocates, including cathy chase, president of advocates for highway and auto safety, who cited uberâ€™s fatal crash, among others, in a statement denouncing av 4.0. â€œdespite these disturbing incidents, the agency tasked with ensuring public safety on our roadways has abrogated their responsibility to issue rules requiring minimum performance standards for avs.â€\\x9d   teslaâ€™s autopilot feature, one of many driver-assist features which allow control of the vehicle to switch from human to computer, can distract drivers or give them a false sense of security. the verge  whatâ€™s the difference between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous?  thereâ€™s one safety debate that continues to divide the self-driving industry: some automakers are still pushing for versions of vehicles which allow control to pass from human to computer, offering drivers the ability to toggle between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous modes. two fatal tesla crashesâ€”one in 2016 and one in 2018â€”that occurred while the drivers were using the vehicleâ€™s autopilot feature illustrated the dangers of a semi-autonomous mode. as the national transportation safety board (ntsb) noted in its report of the 2016 crash, semi-autonomous systems give â€œfar more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.â€\\x9d fully autonomous is the official policy recommendation from the self-driving coalition for safer streets, a lobbying group that wants cars to eventually phase out steering wheels and let the software take over, 100 percent of the time. this completely eliminates the potential for human error. in 2018, waymo began conducting fully autonomous testing in arizona without a human safety driver, and in 2019, began transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles. california now allows fully autonomous testing as well, but without passengers for now. especially after the uber crash, san francisco bike advocates worry that the tech isnâ€™t powerful enough to see cyclists. the california bicycle coalition started a petition to stop fully autonomous vehicles from being tested on california streets.

the case for safety in an op-ed that heralded the dawn of the new driverless age right now too many people die on our roadsâ€”35200 last year aloneâ€”with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year and right now for too many senior citizens and americans with disabilities driving isnâ€™t an option automated vehicles could change their lives in order to get cities across the country to start thinking about using autonomy to solve transportation problems usdot hosted the smart city challenge in 2016 which awarded $40 million to columbus ohio to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles as a result of the challenge the 70 cities that competed now have blueprints for how to introduce av tech to their transportation planning under the trump administration much of the legislation proposed has been centered around exemptions for automakers and increasing the number of avs allowed to operate on us streets in fact in september 2017 usdot and nhtsa issued updated av guidelines which carried an even lighter regulatory touch after industry leaders expressed concerns about regulation at the federal level stifling innovation in addition to the 2017 policy statement transportation secretary elaine chao held preliminary hearings about autonomous vehicles where she affirmed the government would not play a heavy-handed role â€œthe market will decide what is the most effective solutionâ€\\x9d she said however the aggressive development of v2vâ€”which experts agree can work to make human-driven cars much safer as autonomous technology comes to marketâ€”has not been made a priority during her leadership on october 4 2018 usdot announced new guidelines to guide development and deployment of avs including the possibility that the department would change its safety standard rules to allow new types of autonomous vehicles to operate on us roads this would mean potentially making exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operating features like steering wheels chao also addressed the fact that public acceptance was a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption â€œcompanies need to step up and address the publicâ€™s concerns about safetyâ€\\x9d she said â€œbecause without public acceptance the full potential of these technologies may never be realizedâ€\\x9d usdotâ€™s lack of regulation was called out as â€œlaughableâ€\\x9d by ntsb board member jennifer homendy during the november 2019 hearings about uberâ€™s fatal crash â€œi actually think that there is a major failing on the federal governmentâ€™s part and the state of arizona because they also didnâ€™t have any standards in place and still donâ€™t for failing to regulate these operationsâ€\\x9d she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show on january 8 2020 chao announced av 40 a new set of voluntary guidelines which reconfirms the federal governmentâ€™s hands-off approach to av regulation the plan was quickly panned by safety advocates including cathy chase president of advocates for highway and auto safety who cited uberâ€™s fatal crash among others in a statement denouncing av 40 â€œdespite these disturbing incidents the agency tasked with ensuring public safety on our roadways has abrogated their responsibility to issue rules requiring minimum performance standards for avsâ€\\x9d   teslaâ€™s autopilot feature one of many driver-assist features which allow control of the vehicle to switch from human to computer can distract drivers or give them a false sense of security the verge  whatâ€™s the difference between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous  thereâ€™s one safety debate that continues to divide the self-driving industry some automakers are still pushing for versions of vehicles which allow control to pass from human to computer offering drivers the ability to toggle between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous modes two fatal tesla crashesâ€”one in 2016 and one in 2018â€”that occurred while the drivers were using the vehicleâ€™s autopilot feature illustrated the dangers of a semi-autonomous mode as the national transportation safety board (ntsb) noted in its report of the 2016 crash semi-autonomous systems give â€œfar more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than drivingâ€\\x9d fully autonomous is the official policy recommendation from the self-driving coalition for safer streets a lobbying group that wants cars to eventually phase out steering wheels and let the software take over 100 percent of the time this completely eliminates the potential for human error in 2018 waymo began conducting fully autonomous testing in arizona without a human safety driver and in 2019 began transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles california now allows fully autonomous testing as well but without passengers for now especially after the uber crash san francisco bike advocates worry that the tech isnâ€™t powerful enough to see cyclists the california bicycle coalition started a petition to stop fully autonomous vehicles from being tested on california streets  '"

       "'from ushering in an era of decreased car ownership to narrowing streets and eliminating parking lots autonomous vehicles promise to dramatically reshape our cities but after an uber-operated self-driving vehicle struck and killed 49-year-old elaine herzberg who was crossing the street with her bike in tempe arizona on march 18 2018 there are more questions than ever about the safety of this technology especially as these vehicles are being tested more frequently on public streets some argue the safety record for self-driving cars isnâ€™t proven and that itâ€™s unclear whether or not enough testing miles have been driven in real-life conditions other safety advocates go further and say that driverless cars are introducing a new problem to cities when cities should instead be focusing on improving transit and encouraging walking and biking instead contentions aside the autonomous revolution is already here although some cities will see its impacts sooner than others from las vegas where a navya self-driving minibus scoots slowly along a downtown street to general motorsâ€™ cruise ride-hailing service in san francisco with backup humans in the driverâ€™s seat to waymoâ€™s family-focused chandler arizonaâ€“based pilot program that uses no human operators in its chrysler pacifica minivans at all the country is accelerating towards a driverless future while the us government has historically been confident in autonomous vehiclesâ€™ ability to end the epidemic of traffic deaths on our streets there are plenty of concerns from opponents of self-driving cars that are making cities think twice before welcoming them to their streets   self-driving vehicles may be poised to deliver a future of safer greener streets for all but testing the vehicles on todayâ€™s streets is a concern farrells and wsp | parsons brinckerhoff  are autonomous vehicles safe  in 2009 google launched its self-driving project focusing on saving lives and serving people with disabilities in a 2014 video google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles part of the companyâ€™s plan to â€œimprove road safety and help lots of people who canâ€™t driveâ€\\x9d although there were several self-driving projects in the country at the time many being developed by government agencies or university labs googleâ€™s project differentiated itself by being public-facing the goal was not to build carsâ€”although google did build its own testing prototypesâ€”but to create a self-driving service that would help regular people get around google began testing its vehicles on public streets the very same year the project launched with the reorganization of google into its new parent company alphabet the self-driving program became its own entity waymo almost a decade later waymo remains the clear leader for safe self-driving miles on us streets as of november 2019 waymo had logged 10 million self-driven miles making it the leader for self-driven miles on us streets thatâ€™s double the amount of miles waymo had driven in february 2018 in july 2018 waymoâ€™s new electric jaguar i-paces vehicle hit the streets in addition to its chrysler pacifica hybrid minivans according to waymoâ€™s monthly reports its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes but caused no serious injuries in 2016 a waymo vehicle bumped a bus while going 2 miles per hour on may 4 2018 one of waymoâ€™s minivans was involved in a crash with minor injuries in chandler arizona while in autonomous mode but police said waymoâ€™s van was not the â€œviolator vehicleâ€\\x9d in october 2018 a waymo vehicle was involved in a crash that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with minor injuries but the human driver was at fault now there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing on us streets but next most experienced companies uber and gm cruise are still several million miles behind waymo that doesnâ€™t include miles driven in the semi-autonomous modes that many cars now offer like teslaâ€™s autopilot which are more driver-assistance systems than true self-driving vehicles in the last few years the greatest strides taken in the self-driving industry have been by ride-hailing companies who are devoting an exceptional amount of time and money to develop their own proprietary technologies and in many cases giving members of the public rides in their vehicles in 2017 lyftâ€™s ceo predicted that within five years all their vehicles will be autonomous at a press conference in march 2018 where waymoâ€™s ceo john krafcik announced its ride-hailing program krafcik claimed that the company will be making at least one million trips per day by 2020  can autonomous cars drive better than humans  the biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a humanâ€”it is programmed to obey all the rules of the road wonâ€™t speed and canâ€™t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone and hypothetically at least avs can also detect what humans canâ€™tâ€”especially at night or in low-light conditionsâ€”and react more quickly to avoid a collision avs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road one key technology for avs is lidar or a â€œlight-detecting and rangingâ€\\x9d sensor using millions of lasers lidar draws a real-time 3d image of the environment around the vehicle in addition to lidar radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects and high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals as the car is traveling it cross-references all this data with gps technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route in addition to the sensors and maps avs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles humans or objects in the road engineers can run the cars through simulations but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations this is why real-world testing on public roads is so important but how av companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users like cyclists and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets like seniors and children waymo for example claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists a video that waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night according to a may 2018 report from the information uberâ€™s vehicle did detect herzberg before its fatal tempe crash but the system made a decision not to swerve â€œthe carâ€™s sensors detected the pedestrian who was crossing the street with a bicycle but uberâ€™s software decided it didnâ€™t need to react right awayâ€\\x9d a preliminary report by the national transportation safety board (ntsb) confirmed that not only had uber disabled the volvo suvâ€™s collision-avoidance feature uberâ€™s own system detected herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 13 seconds before impact however arizona prosecutors did not charge uber writing in a letter that â€œthere is no basis for criminal liability for the uber corporation arising from this matterâ€\\x9d uberâ€™s self-driving unit arizona announced it was closing down on may 23 2018 in july uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in pittsburgh and san francisco uberâ€™s self-driving program has since returned to pittsburgh where it is limiting testing to daylight hours the role of human â€œbackup driversâ€\\x9d as part of av testing has also come into question after tempe police documents obtained by gizmodo showed that driver rafaela vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of uberâ€™s fatal crash â€œthe driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 4261 feet prior to the pedestrianâ€\\x9d reads the report which calls the crash â€œentirely avoidableâ€\\x9d in november 2019 the final ntsb report attributed the crash to human error but placed much of the blame on vasquez at the ntsb hearing board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax self-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets many traditional automakers use a facility named m city in ann arbor michigan but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles waymoâ€™s fake city named castle even has a shed full of propsâ€”like tricyclesâ€”that might be used by people on streets so that waymoâ€™s engineers can learn how to identify them after uberâ€™s fatal crash toyota built a new facility to test its vehiclesâ€™ responses to â€œedge casesâ€\\x9dâ€”extreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets   usdot has been testing autonomous technology at the m city facility for many years m city  will eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths  50 years ago the usâ€™s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are nowâ€”in 1980 generally considered to be the deadliest year on us streets over 50000 people were killed with safety features like airbags added to vehicles stricter seat belt laws and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving the rate of deaths went down significantly but over the last few years the us has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again additionally pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent there isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths are increasing but some experts believe that this is because americans are driving moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles traveled (vmt) reached an all-time high in 2017 using usdotâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel but itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced the us could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that too the real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand routed more efficiently and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled in addition cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet if cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit according to a 2016 american public transportation association study traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car without having to make room for so many cars city streets can be narrowed making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities in this way autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a vision zero strategy which most major us cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths   a typical us roadway remade as a safe accessible street filled with autonomous technology from shared taxibots to self-driving buses from nactoâ€™s blueprint for autonomous urbanism nacto  but arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now too  while residents of only a few cities can summon an av on-demand right now the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into todayâ€™s cars sophisticated collision-avoidance systems for example which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path are already being incorporated into new cars and buses this is why the way the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing until recently all safety standards were based on historical crash data meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and in many cases deaths) before making an official recommendation now technology is advancing so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade the government knows it needs to be more nimble in fact thatâ€™s what happened for a recent usdot recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (v2v) a tool which allows cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other this recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by us transportation secretary anthony foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obviousâ€”there was no need to spend years collecting historical data the same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles   an 8-person autonomous shuttle by navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in downtown las vegas keolis  where are self-driving cars being tested  about half of us states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads but regulations for each state vary widely the majority of testing is focused in a handful of states arizona california georgia michigan nevada texas pennsylvania and washington california remains the busiest hub for the av industry there are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the stateâ€™s streets itâ€™s also one of the most heavily regulated markets californiaâ€™s department of motor vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes while itâ€™s not necessarily used as a safety metric one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over which is called a â€œdisengagementâ€\\x9d california dmv records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience they see fewer and fewer disengagements other states donâ€™t require as much documentation as californiaâ€”and theyâ€™re not necessarily required to make any information public arizona for example approved av testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents and didnâ€™t require any reports from companies although after uberâ€™s fatal crash that has changed uber self-driving car  hills snow quirky local driving customs and loose state

decrease by 14 percent there isnâ€™t agreement for why these deaths be increase but some experts believe that this be because americans be drive moreâ€”overall vehicle-miles travel (vmt) reach an all-time high in 2017 use usdotâ€™s claim that 94 percent of crash be cause by human error it seem like a fairly obvious way to reduce crash be to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel but itâ€™s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduce the us could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalitiesâ€”and autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that too the real safety promise of autonomous vehicles be the fact that these vehicles can be be summon on-demand rout more efficiently and easily sharedâ€”meaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline but the number of single-passenger trip will be reduce mean a reduction in overall miles travel in addition cities can use automate vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit project like a propose initiative to integrate share self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet if cities can launch these kind of â€œmicrotransitâ€\\x9d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit accord to a 2016 american public transportation association study travel by public transportation be ten time safer per mile than travel by car without have to make room for so many cars city streets can be narrow make even more room for pedestrians and bike to safely navigate cities in this way autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a vision zero strategy which most major us cities have implement in order to eliminate traffic deaths   a typical us roadway remake as a safe accessible street fill with autonomous technology from share taxibots to self-driving bus from nactoâ€™s blueprint for autonomous urbanism nacto  but arenâ€™t human-driven cars safer now too  while residents of only a few cities can summon an av on-demand right now the truth be that much of the safety tech power self-driving cars be make its way into todayâ€™s cars sophisticate collision-avoidance systems for example which can stop a vehicle if an object or person be detect in its path be already be incorporate into new cars and bus this be why the way the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) test those kinds of safety innovations be also change until recently all safety standards be base on historical crash data mean the government have to track years and years of roadway incidents (and in many case deaths) before make an official recommendation now technology be advance so quickly that thereâ€™s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade the government know it need to be more nimble in fact thatâ€™s what happen for a recent usdot recommendation that all cars be equip with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (v2v) a tool which allow cars to â€œtalkâ€\\x9d to each other this recommendation be fast-tracked in 2015 by us transportation secretary anthony foxx after detail simulations and model show that the benefit be obviousâ€”there be no need to spend years collect historical data the same type of recommendation might be make for an aspect of autonomous tech once a clear safety benefit have be prove across the self-driving industry a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles   an 8-person autonomous shuttle by navya travel a

document list many benefit for bring technology to market among them improve sustainability productivity and accessibility but the usdot reportâ€™s central promise be that autonomy will pave the way for policies that dramatically improve road safety even president obama make the case for safety in an op-ed that herald the dawn of the new driverless age right now too many people die on our roadsâ€”35200 last year aloneâ€”with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice automate vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of live each year and right now for too many senior citizens and americans with disabilities drive isnâ€™t an option automate vehicles could change their live in order to get cities across the country to start think about use autonomy to solve transportation problems usdot host the smart city challenge in 2016 which award $40 million to columbus ohio to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles as a result of the challenge the 70 cities that compete now have blueprint for how to introduce av tech to their transportation plan under the trump administration much of the legislation propose have be center around exemptions for automakers and increase the number of avs allow to operate on us streets in fact in september 2017 usdot and nhtsa issue update av guidelines which carry an even lighter regulatory touch after industry leaders express concern about regulation at the federal level stifle innovation in addition to the 2017 policy statement transportation secretary elaine chao hold preliminary hear about autonomous vehicles where she affirm the government would not play a heavy-handed role â€œthe market will decide what be the most effective solutionâ€\\x9d she say however the aggressive development of v2vâ€”which experts agree can work to make human-driven cars much safer as autonomous technology come to marketâ€”has not be make a priority during her leadership on october 4 2018 usdot announce new guidelines to guide development and deployment of avs include the possibility that the department would change its safety standard rule to allow new type of autonomous vehicles to operate on us roads this would mean potentially make exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operate feature like steer wheel chao also address the fact that public acceptance be a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption â€œcompanies need to step up and address the publicâ€™s concern about safetyâ€\\x9d she say â€œbecause without public acceptance the full potential of these technologies may never be realizedâ€\\x9d usdotâ€™s lack of regulation be call out as â€œlaughableâ€\\x9d by ntsb board member jennifer homendy during the november 2019 hear about uberâ€™s fatal crash
