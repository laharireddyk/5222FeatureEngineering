For the car enthusiast, thinking about anything beyond the next 10 years or so means thinking, at least in part, about self-driving cars. And part of thinking about self-driving cars is wondering how they might change the way we live.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look back 15 years or so, before the smartphone went mainstream, it's easy to see how a small difference\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201done small device\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dcan have a monumental and lasting impact; in the smartphone's case, it was spawning the always-on, social-media-fueled barrage of technology now plaguing pockets and purses everywhere. Looking around today, Tesla Motors is the most valuable carmaker in the world, and it's not because it's wildly profitable, or even profitable at all. It's because investors are betting on the future, and they think the future will be electric and autonomous. They're not alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotorTrend's Kim Reynolds wrote an article late last year detailing the promise and pitfalls of self-driving cars. In that article, he recounted a 2016 trip to the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Ford's Research and Innovation Campus in Palo Alto, California, during which Ford's then-CEO Mark Fields said, \\\"The next decade will be defined by automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla was one of the first to take serious action on self-driving cars, although it took awhile for the industry to take the upstart company seriously. The public, on the other hand, took to the Roadster and Model S, and later to the Model 3 and Y, like kids take to iPhones. While Tesla appears to still have an edge over the competition, its decade-long head start seems to have been mostly squandered, the company continually moving the always-imminent arrival of full, \\\"sleep in the car\\\" Level 5 self-driving autonomy. Companies like Google parent Alphabet's Waymo, as detailed in Reynolds' article, and General Motors' Super Cruise, have either caught up with or surpassed Tesla, depending who you ask, and other carmakers like Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen all have self-driving programs in the works, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut right now, the question of who will end up a winner in the self-driving car race isn't about the companies that will bring it into being. It's about the rest of us\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthose who'll have to live with the results.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-Driving Cars Aren't For Everyone\\r\\nFamed novelist William Gibson probably wasn't the first person in history to notice this phenomenon, but he was the one who put it in an inimitably succinct and clear form, back in the early 1990s: \\\"The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed.\\\" Right now, some form of self-driving is available on a lot of cars\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dbut only new cars, and even then, the best features are reserved for the most expensive models, with self-driving features often costing thousands of dollars on top of the price of an already expensive new car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high cost of entry to the self-driving world is what's limiting the distribution at present. But as the technology matures and supporting sensor and computing technologies gain more widespread use in other industries, the infrastructure necessary to bring down costs for Level 1 and Level 2 self-driving (similar to Tesla's current Autopilot implementation) is already coming online, promising to put the cost of such systems within the reach of more buyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still, that word\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dbuyers. New cars. If you want to be part of the autonomous revolution, you'd better have some money to spend, because this revolution isn't free, and it's not for everyone. That may be a good thing, however, as most Americans seem to be a little bit scared of self-driving cars, according to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's already a \\\"digital divide\\\" in America, a phrase that describes the disparate distribution of the future in the present: According to Pew, nearly one-third of American adults with household incomes of less than $30,000 per year don't own a smartphone, and only a little more than half of them own a desktop or laptop computer. Contrast those figures with 97 percent smartphone ownership and 94 percent desktop or laptop ownership among households with $100,000 or more in annual income. As the technology we use to work, live, and move about in our daily lives becomes more and more expensive, that divide only gets broader. Self-driving (or semi-self-driving) cars are among the most expensive of consumer technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon't think this is all just academic drivel; these concepts are alive in the general popular culture. The futuristic sci-fi Amazon Prime series Upload features the digital divide theme throughout its 10-episode first season, but it's the season-opener that ought to strike a blow with car enthusiasts (spoiler alert): Just before the show's protagonist dies in a self-driving car crash (an occurrence which everyone seems to think should be impossible), his fianc\\u00c3\\u00a9e puts his car in \\\"Prioritize Occupant\\\" mode\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201da setting that will protect the life of the car's occupant over that of anyone outside. While the irony is unmissable, the real gem here is the fact that it's presumed the hyper-wealthy will continue to accrue power and privilege to the point that they'll literally be able to tell their computer-driven cars to run people over with the flick of a switch. Let's hope it doesn't become a sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven If Everyone Had Self-Driving Cars, It Wouldn't Solve Everything\\r\\nIt's easy to get caught up in the fetishized vision we often seem to share of the future: A clean, sparkly place where sleekly clad people glide in and out of silent, pod-like cars that cruise the city like tireless cabbies crossed with faithful robot dogs. But while a few are living the preview of that life now, and more will in the near- and medium-term future, fully autonomous self-driving cars are much further away than most people think, at least for private ownership.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we get to personal, fully self-driving (Level 5) vehicles, we'll have fleets of automated taxis, or trundling lines of self-driving shuttles on campuses and at sporting events, or you might even ride a self-driving bus from your company's remote parking lot into work. But in doing so, we could see hundreds of thousands of those who drive for a living lose their jobs\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand that's before we look at the freight and delivery industry. (Do note the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecast in the linked data highlighting a \\\"much faster than average\\\" 20 percent rate of growth for the taxi-driving, ride-hailing, and chauffeur fields through 2028\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthe BLS clearly doesn't think self-driving cars will be hitting the streets in any significant form before the decade is out.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, a big part of the problem with cars, and the enjoyment of cars, is not that real people drive them, it's that they're everywhere. Roads, highways, freeways, interstates, parking lots, parking garages, parking decks, driveways, home garages\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201deverywhere. In the glibly titled \\\"Crowdsourced Quantification and Visualization of Urban Mobility Space Inequality,\\\" by Michael Szell, a mobility and sustainable transport researcher currently at ITU Copenhagen, published in the journal Urban Planning, the \\\"spatial inefficiency\\\" of cars is made clear: even in an extremely car-centric city like Los Angeles, considerably more space is allocated to car use than is actually used, as a percentage of the share of the mode of transport, when compared to other modes like rail or bicycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Los Angeles' case, 92 percent of its transportation land area is dedicated to vehicle use versus four percent each allocated to bicycle and rail use. In reality, only 78 percent of L.A. 's transit happens by car, with rail accounting for 11 percent, and bicycles just one percent. In other global cities, the misallocation of resources is even more extreme: Beijing's vehicle share of the transportation space is 68 percent, while only 21 percent of its travel is done by car; conversely, rail and bicycles account for 58 percent of travel, but only 32 percent of the space dedicated to Beijing's transport.\", \"Category\": \"Alto\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"Lahari_Assg1.txt-Alto\"}, {\"File_Name\": \"Lahari_Assg2.txt\", \"Content\": \"From ushering in an era of decreased car ownership, to narrowing streets and eliminating parking lots, autonomous vehicles promise to dramatically reshape our cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after an Uber-operated self-driving vehicle struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who was crossing the street with her bike in Tempe, Arizona on March 18, 2018, there are more questions than ever about the safety of this technology, especially as these vehicles are being tested more frequently on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome argue the safety record for self-driving cars isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t proven, and that it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s unclear whether or not enough testing miles have been driven in real-life conditions. Other safety advocates go further, and say that driverless cars are introducing a new problem to cities, when cities should instead be focusing on improving transit and encouraging walking and biking instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nContentions aside, the autonomous revolution is already here, although some cities will see its impacts sooner than others. From Las Vegas, where a Navya self-driving minibus scoots slowly along a downtown street, to General Motors\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 Cruise ride-hailing service in San Francisco with backup humans in the driver\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s seat, to Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s family-focused Chandler, Arizona\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201cbased pilot program that uses no human operators in its Chrysler Pacifica minivans at all, the country is accelerating towards a driverless future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the U.S. government has historically been confident in autonomous vehicles\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 ability to end the epidemic of traffic deaths on our streets, there are plenty of concerns from opponents of self-driving cars that are making cities think twice before welcoming them to their streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving vehicles may be poised to deliver a future of safer, greener streets for all, but testing the vehicles on today\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s streets is a concern. Farrells and WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff\\r\\nAre autonomous vehicles safe?\\r\\nIn 2009, Google launched its self-driving project focusing on saving lives and serving people with disabilities. In a 2014 video, Google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles, part of the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s plan to \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153improve road safety and help lots of people who can\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t drive.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there were several self-driving projects in the country at the time, many being developed by government agencies or university labs, Google\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s project differentiated itself by being public-facing. The goal was not to build cars\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dalthough Google did build its own testing prototypes\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dbut to create a self-driving service that would help regular people get around.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle began testing its vehicles on public streets the very same year the project launched. With the reorganization of Google into its new parent company Alphabet, the self-driving program became its own entity, Waymo. Almost a decade later, Waymo remains the clear leader for safe self-driving miles on U.S. streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 2019, Waymo had logged 10 million self-driven miles, making it the leader for self-driven miles on U.S. streets. That\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s double the amount of miles Waymo had driven in February 2018. In July 2018, Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s new electric Jaguar I-Paces vehicle hit the streets, in addition to its Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s monthly reports, its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes, but caused no serious injuries. In 2016, a Waymo vehicle bumped a bus while going 2 miles per hour. On May 4, 2018, one of Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s minivans was involved in a crash with minor injuries in Chandler, Arizona while in autonomous mode, but police said Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s van was not the \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153violator vehicle.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d In October 2018 a Waymo vehicle was involved in a crash that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with minor injuries, but the human driver was at fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing on U.S. streets, but next most experienced companies, Uber and GM Cruise, are still several million miles behind Waymo. That doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t include miles driven in the semi-autonomous modes that many cars now offer, like Tesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot, which are more driver-assistance systems than true self-driving vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last few years, the greatest strides taken in the self-driving industry have been by ride-hailing companies, who are devoting an exceptional amount of time and money to develop their own proprietary technologies and, in many cases, giving members of the public rides in their vehicles. In 2017, Lyft\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s CEO predicted that within five years, all their vehicles will be autonomous. At a press conference in March 2018, where Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s CEO John Krafcik announced its ride-hailing program, Krafcik claimed that the company will be making at least one million trips per day by 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCan autonomous cars drive better than humans?\\r\\nThe biggest safety advantage to an autonomous vehicle is that a robot is not a human\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dit is programmed to obey all the rules of the road, won\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t speed, and can\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t be distracted by a text message flickering onto a phone. And, hypothetically at least, AVs can also detect what humans can\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201despecially at night or in low-light conditions\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand react more quickly to avoid a collision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAVs are laden with sensors and software that work together to build a complete picture of the road. One key technology for AVs is LIDAR, or a \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153light-detecting and ranging\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d sensor. Using millions of lasers, LIDAR draws a real-time, 3D image of the environment around the vehicle. In addition to LIDAR, radar sensors can measure the size and speed of moving objects. And high-definition cameras can actually read signs and signals. As the car is traveling, it cross-references all this data with GPS technology that situates the vehicle within a city and helps to plan its route.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the sensors and maps, AVs run software programs which make real-time decisions about how the car will navigate relative to other vehicles, humans, or objects in the road. Engineers can run the cars through simulations, but the software also needs to learn from actual driving situations. This is why real-world testing on public roads is so important.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how AV companies gather that information has led to greater concerns about how autonomous vehicles can detect and avoid vulnerable road users, like cyclists, and people who move slowly and more erratically through streets, like seniors and children. Waymo, for example, claims its software has been explicitly programmed to recognize cyclists. A video that Waymo released in 2016 (back when it was still part of Google) shows how one of its vehicles detected and stopped for a wrong-way cyclist coming around a corner at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a May 2018 report from The Information, Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s vehicle did detect Herzberg before its fatal Tempe crash, but the system made a decision not to swerve. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153The car\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s sensors detected the pedestrian, who was crossing the street with a bicycle, but Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s software decided it didn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t need to react right away.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed that not only had Uber disabled the Volvo SUV\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s collision-avoidance feature, Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s own system detected Herzberg six seconds before the crash and did not brake until 1.3 seconds before impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Arizona prosecutors did not charge Uber, writing in a letter that \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153there is no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation arising from this matter.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nUber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s self-driving unit Arizona announced it was closing down on May 23, 2018. In July, Uber eliminated 100 self-driving positions in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s self-driving program has since returned to Pittsburgh, where it is limiting testing to daylight hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of human \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153backup drivers\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d as part of AV testing has also come into question after Tempe police documents obtained by Gizmodo showed that driver Rafaela Vasquez was streaming a video on her phone at the time of Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fatal crash. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153The driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d reads the report, which calls the crash \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153entirely avoidable.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2019, the final NTSB report attributed the crash to human error, but placed much of the blame on Vasquez. At the NTSB hearing, board members also criticized the federal government for safety regulations that are too lax.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-driving companies also put their vehicles through endless tests using simulated city streets. Many traditional automakers use a facility named M City in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the larger self-driving companies have built their own fake cities specifically to test interactions with humans who are not in vehicles. Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fake city, named Castle, even has a shed full of props\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dlike tricycles\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthat might be used by people on streets so that Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s engineers can learn how to identify them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fatal crash, Toyota built a new facility to test its vehicles\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 responses to \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153edge cases\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dextreme situations too dangerous to test on public streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOT has been testing autonomous technology at the M City facility for many years. M City\\r\\nWill eliminating human drivers reduce traffic deaths?\\r\\n50 years ago, the U.S.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s rate of traffic deaths was higher than they are now\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201din 1980, generally considered to be the deadliest year on U.S. streets, over 50,000 people were killed. With safety features like airbags added to vehicles, stricter seat belt laws, and campaigns that stigmatized drunk driving, the rate of deaths went down significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut over the last few years, the U.S. has seen a slight increase in traffic deaths again. Additionally, pedestrian fatalities increased by 27 percent over the last decade, while all other traffic fatalities decreased by 14 percent. There isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t agreement for why these deaths are increasing, but some experts believe that this is because Americans are driving more\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201doverall vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) reached an all-time high in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing USDOT\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s claim that 94 percent of crashes are caused by human error, it seems like a fairly obvious way to reduce crashes is to reduce the number of humans behind the wheel. But it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not just the number of human drivers that should be reduced, the U.S. could also reduce the number of cars on roads to prevent fatalities\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand autonomous vehicles might be able to help do that, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real safety promise of autonomous vehicles is the fact that these vehicles can be be summoned on-demand, routed more efficiently, and easily shared\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dmeaning not just the overall number of single-passenger cars on streets will decline, but the number of single-passenger trips will be reduced, meaning a reduction in overall miles traveled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, cities can use automated vehicles to tackle ambitious on-demand transit projects, like a proposed initiative to integrate shared self-driving vehicles into the public transit fleet. If cities can launch these kind of \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153microtransit\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d systems that serve as a first-mile/last-mile solution to help get more people to fixed-route public transportation, that will also mean fewer people in cars and more people on safer modes of transit. According to a 2016 American Public Transportation Association study, traveling by public transportation is ten times safer per mile than traveling by car.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout having to make room for so many cars, city streets can be narrowed, making even more room for pedestrians and bikes to safely navigate cities. In this way, autonomous vehicles have a great role to play as part of a Vision Zero strategy, which most major U.S. cities have implemented in order to eliminate traffic deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical U.S. roadway remade as a safe, accessible street filled with autonomous technology, from shared taxibots to self-driving buses, from NACTO\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Blueprint for Autonomous Urbanism. NACTO\\r\\nBut aren\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t human-driven cars safer now, too?\\r\\nWhile residents of only a few cities can summon an AV on-demand right now, the truth is that much of the safety tech powering self-driving cars is making its way into today\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s cars. Sophisticated collision-avoidance systems, for example, which can stop a vehicle if an object or person are detected in its path, are already being incorporated into new cars and buses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why the way the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) tests those kinds of safety innovations is also changing. Until recently, all safety standards were based on historical crash data, meaning the government had to track years and years of roadway incidents (and, in many cases, deaths) before making an official recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, technology is advancing so quickly that there\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not enough time to test every new idea for a decade. The government knows it needs to be more nimble.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, that\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s what happened for a recent USDOT recommendation that all cars be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), a tool which allows cars to \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153talk\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d to each other. This recommendation was fast-tracked in 2015 by U.S. transportation secretary Anthony Foxx after detailed simulations and modeling showed that the benefits were obvious\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthere was no need to spend years collecting historical data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same type of recommendation might be made for an aspect of autonomous tech. Once a clear safety benefit has been proven across the self-driving industry, a specific feature might become standard on all vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 8-person autonomous shuttle by Navya travels a route at a speed of 15 mph in Downtown Las Vegas. Keolis\\r\\nWhere are self-driving cars being tested?\\r\\nAbout half of U.S. states allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads, but regulations for each state vary widely. The majority of testing is focused in a handful of states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia remains the busiest hub for the AV industry: There are currently 52 companies testing self-driving technology on the state\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s streets. It\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s also one of the most heavily regulated markets: California\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Department of Motor Vehicles requires companies to file for a permit and submit annual reports that include the number of miles driven and any crashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s not necessarily used as a safety metric, one performance standard that helps to illustrate how technology is improving is tracking the number of times per self-driving mile that a human driver has to take over, which is called a \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153disengagement.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d California DMV records demonstrate that as self-driving programs log more on-road experience, they see fewer and fewer disengagements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther states don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t require as much documentation as California\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re not necessarily required to make any information public. Arizona, for example, approved AV testing on public roads in 2016 without notifying its residents, and didn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t require any reports from companies, although after Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fatal crash, that has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nUber Self-Driving Car\\r\\nHills, snow, quirky local driving customs, and loose state regulations are some of the reasons Uber started testing its self-driving program in Pittsburgh. AP Photo/Jared Wickerham\\r\\nDoes the federal government regulate autonomous vehicles?\\r\\nIn 2016, the U.S. government released its long-awaited rules on self-driving vehicles. The Department of Transportation\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 116-page document lists many benefits for bringing technology to market, among them improved sustainability, productivity, and accessibility. But the USDOT report\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s central promise is that autonomy will pave the way for policies that dramatically improve road safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven President Obama made the case for safety in an op-ed that heralded the dawn of the new driverless age:\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, too many people die on our roads\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d35,200 last year alone\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dwith 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice. Automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. And right now, for too many senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, driving isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t an option. Automated vehicles could change their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to get cities across the country to start thinking about using autonomy to solve transportation problems, USDOT hosted the Smart City Challenge in 2016, which awarded $40 million to Columbus, Ohio, to develop a fleet of autonomous transit vehicles. As a result of the challenge, the 70 cities that competed now have blueprints for how to introduce AV tech to their transportation planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Trump administration, much of the legislation proposed has been centered around exemptions for automakers and increasing the number of AVs allowed to operate on U.S. streets. In fact, in September 2017, USDOT and NHTSA issued updated AV guidelines, which carried an even lighter regulatory touch, after industry leaders expressed concerns about regulation at the federal level stifling innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the 2017 policy statement, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao held preliminary hearings about autonomous vehicles where she affirmed the government would not play a heavy-handed role. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153The market will decide what is the most effective solution,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d she said. However, the aggressive development of V2V\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dwhich experts agree can work to make human-driven cars much safer as autonomous technology comes to market\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dhas not been made a priority during her leadership.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 4, 2018, USDOT announced new guidelines to guide development and deployment of AVs, including the possibility that the department would change its safety standard rules to allow new types of autonomous vehicles to operate on U.S. roads. This would mean potentially making exemptions for automakers to produce vehicles without human-centered operating features like steering wheels.\\r\\n\\r\\nChao also addressed the fact that public acceptance was a key element for autonomous vehicle adoption. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Companies need to step up and address the public\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s concerns about safety,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d she said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Because without public acceptance, the full potential of these technologies may never be realized.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nUSDOT\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s lack of regulation was called out as \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153laughable\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d by NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy during the November 2019 hearings about Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fatal crash. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153I actually think that there is a major failing on the federal government\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s part and the state of Arizona, because they also didn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t have any standards in place and still don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t, for failing to regulate these operations,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 8, 2020, Chao announced AV 4.0, a new set of voluntary guidelines which reconfirms the federal government\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s hands-off approach to AV regulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was quickly panned by safety advocates, including Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, who cited Uber\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s fatal crash, among others, in a statement denouncing AV 4.0. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Despite these disturbing incidents, the agency tasked with ensuring public safety on our roadways has abrogated their responsibility to issue rules requiring minimum performance standards for AVs.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot feature, one of many driver-assist features which allow control of the vehicle to switch from human to computer, can distract drivers or give them a false sense of security. The Verge\\r\\nWhat\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s the difference between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous?\\r\\nThere\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s one safety debate that continues to divide the self-driving industry: Some automakers are still pushing for versions of vehicles which allow control to pass from human to computer, offering drivers the ability to toggle between semi-autonomous and fully autonomous modes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo fatal Tesla crashes\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201done in 2016 and one in 2018\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dthat occurred while the drivers were using the vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot feature illustrated the dangers of a semi-autonomous mode. As the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) noted in its report of the 2016 crash, semi-autonomous systems give \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153far more leeway to the driver to divert his attention to something other than driving.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nFully autonomous is the official policy recommendation from the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, a lobbying group that wants cars to eventually phase out steering wheels and let the software take over, 100 percent of the time. This completely eliminates the potential for human error.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Waymo began conducting fully autonomous testing in Arizona without a human safety driver, and in 2019, began transporting passengers in fully autonomous vehicles. California now allows fully autonomous testing as well, but without passengers for now.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially after the Uber crash, San Francisco bike advocates worry that the tech isn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t powerful enough to see cyclists. The California Bicycle Coalition started a petition to stop fully autonomous vehicles from being tested on California streets.\\r\\n\", \"Category\": \"Ferrari\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"Lahari_Assg2.txt-Ferrari\"}]}}, {\"mode\": \"vega-lite\"});\n",

       "'Ask nine futurists what life will be like in 50 years and you\\'re liable to get a dozen answers, but that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t worth thinking about. For the car enthusiast, thinking about anything beyond the next 10 years or so means thinking, at least in part, about self-driving cars. And part of thinking about self-driving cars is wondering how they might change the way we live.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look back 15 years or so, before the smartphone went mainstream, it\\'s easy to see how a small differenceâ€”one small deviceâ€”can have a monumental and lasting impact; in the smartphone\\'s case, it was spawning the always-on, social-media-fueled barrage of technology now plaguing pockets and purses everywhere. Looking around today, Tesla Motors is the most valuable carmaker in the world, and it\\'s not because it\\'s wildly profitable, or even profitable at all. It\\'s because investors are betting on the future, and they think the future will be electric and autonomous. They\\'re not alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotorTrend\\'s Kim Reynolds wrote an article late last year detailing the promise and pitfalls of self-driving cars. In that article, he recounted a 2016 trip to the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Ford\\'s Research and Innovation Campus in Palo Alto, California, during which Ford\\'s then-CEO Mark Fields said, \"The next decade will be defined by automation of the automobile, and we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford\\'s moving assembly line did 100 years ago.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla was one of the first to take serious action on self-driving cars, although it took awhile for the industry to take the upstart company seriously. The public, on the other hand, took to the Roadster and Model S, and later to the Model 3 and Y, like kids take to iPhones. While Tesla appears to still have an edge over the competition, its decade-long head start seems to have been mostly squandered, the company continually moving the always-imminent arrival of full, \"sleep in the car\" Level 5 self-driving autonomy. Companies like Google parent Alphabet\\'s Waymo, as detailed in Reynolds\\' article, and General Motors\\' Super Cruise, have either caught up with or surpassed Tesla, depending who you ask, and other carmakers like Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Ford, and Volkswagen all have self-driving programs in the works, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut right now, the question of who will end up a winner in the self-driving car race isn\\'t about the companies that will bring it into being. It\\'s about the rest of usâ€”those who\\'ll have to live with the results.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-Driving Cars Aren\\'t For Everyone\\r\\nFamed novelist William Gibson probably wasn\\'t the first person in history to notice this phenomenon, but he was the one who put it in an inimitably succinct and clear form, back in the early 1990s: \"The future is already here, it\\'s just not very evenly distributed.\" Right now, some form of self-driving is available on a lot of carsâ€”but only new cars, and even then, the best features are reserved for the most expensive models, with self-driving features often costing thousands of dollars on top of the price of an already expensive new car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe high cost of entry to the self-driving world is what\\'s limiting the distribution at present. But as the technology matures and supporting sensor and computing technologies gain more widespread use in other industries, the infrastructure necessary to bring down costs for Level 1 and Level 2 self-driving (similar to Tesla\\'s current Autopilot implementation) is already coming online, promising to put the cost of such systems within the reach of more buyers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still, that wordâ€”buyers. New cars. If you want to be part of the autonomous revolution, you\\'d better have some money to spend, because this revolution isn\\'t free, and it\\'s not for everyone. That may be a good thing, however, as most Americans seem to be a little bit scared of self-driving cars, according to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s already a \"digital divide\" in America, a phrase that describes the disparate distribution of the future in the present: According to Pew, nearly one-third of American adults with household incomes of less than $30,000 per year don\\'t own a smartphone, and only a little more than half of them own a desktop or laptop computer. Contrast those figures with 97 percent smartphone ownership and 94 percent desktop or laptop ownership among households with $100,000 or more in annual income. As the technology we use to work, live, and move about in our daily lives becomes more and more expensive, that divide only gets broader. Self-driving (or semi-self-driving) cars are among the most expensive of consumer technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t think this is all just academic drivel; these concepts are alive in the general popular culture. The futuristic sci-fi Amazon Prime series Upload features the digital divide theme throughout its 10-episode first season, but it\\'s the season-opener that ought to strike a blow with car enthusiasts (spoiler alert): Just before the show\\'s protagonist dies in a self-driving car crash (an occurrence which everyone seems to think should be impossible), his fiancÃ©e puts his car in \"Prioritize Occupant\" modeâ€”a setting that will protect the life of the car\\'s occupant over that of anyone outside. While the irony is unmissable, the real gem here is the fact that it\\'s presumed the hyper-wealthy will continue to accrue power and privilege to the point that they\\'ll literally be able to tell their computer-driven cars to run people over with the flick of a switch. Let\\'s hope it doesn\\'t become a sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven If Everyone Had Self-Driving Cars, It Wouldn\\'t Solve Everything\\r\\nIt\\'s easy to get caught up in the fetishized vision we often seem to share of the future: A clean, sparkly place where sleekly clad people glide in and out of silent, pod-like cars that cruise the city like tireless cabbies crossed with faithful robot dogs. But while a few are living the preview of that life now, and more will in the near- and medium-term future, fully autonomous self-driving cars are much further away than most people think, at least for private ownership.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we get to personal, fully self-driving (Level 5) vehicles, we\\'ll have fleets of automated taxis, or trundling lines of self-driving shuttles on campuses and at sporting events, or you might even ride a self-driving bus from your company\\'s remote parking lot into work. But in doing so, we could see hundreds of thousands of those who drive for a living lose their jobsâ€”and that\\'s before we look at the freight and delivery industry. (Do note the Bureau of Labor Statistics forecast in the linked data highlighting a \"much faster than average\" 20 percent rate of growth for the taxi-driving, ride-hailing, and chauffeur fields through 2028â€”the BLS clearly doesn\\'t think self-driving cars will be hitting the streets in any significant form before the decade is out.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, a big part of the problem with cars, and the enjoyment of cars, is not that real people drive them, it\\'s that they\\'re everywhere. Roads, highways, freeways, interstates, parking lots, parking garages, parking decks, driveways, home garagesâ€”everywhere. In the glibly titled \"Crowdsourced Quantification and Visualization of Urban Mobility Space Inequality,\" by Michael Szell, a mobility and sustainable transport researcher currently at ITU Copenhagen, published in the journal Urban Planning, the \"spatial inefficiency\" of cars is made clear: even in an extremely car-centric city like Los Angeles, considerably more space is allocated to car use than is actually used, as a percentage of the share of the mode of transport, when compared to other modes like rail or bicycle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Los Angeles\\' case, 92 percent of its transportation land area is dedicated to vehicle use versus four percent each allocated to bicycle and rail use. In reality, only 78 percent of L.A. \\'s transit happens by car, with rail accounting for 11 percent, and bicycles just one percent. In other global cities, the misallocation of resources is even more extreme: Beijing\\'s vehicle share of the transportation space is 68 percent, while only 21 percent of its travel is done by car; conversely, rail and bicycles account for 58 percent of travel, but only 32 percent of the space dedicated to Beijing\\'s transport.'"
